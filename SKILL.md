# Data-Driven Decision Culture

Design organizational systems where data beats opinion - implement transparency, OKRs, and decision-making frameworks that empower anyone with data to challenge anyone with authority.

**Token Budget:** ~750 tokens

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Design systems that use data to surveil or punish employees
- Create metrics that measure vanity over value
- Recommend transparency that violates privacy or security
- Build cultures where data is weaponized for political purposes

**If asked to design surveillance systems:** Refuse. Explain the difference between accountability and control.

---

## When to Use

- User says "Decisions here are too political"
- User mentions "The HiPPO always wins"
- User needs "Better decision-making processes"
- User asks about "Implementing OKRs"
- User wants to "Build a data culture"
- User describes decisions made on "gut feeling" when data exists

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Current decision-making | Yes | How decisions are made today |
| Information flow | Yes | How information moves through the org |
| Existing metrics | No | What's currently measured |
| Meeting structure | No | How meetings are run |
| Power dynamics | No | Who controls decisions vs. who has data |

---

## Core Principles

**Key insight:** "In God we trust, all others must bring data."

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Data beats opinion | The person with data wins the argument, regardless of rank |
| Default to open | Information shared broadly unless specific reason not to |
| Questions over answers | "We run the company on questions, not answers" |
| Speed over perfection | "Even if it's the wrong decision, a quick decision is better" |
| OKRs for alignment | Goals and metrics visible company-wide |

**Anti-pattern (HiPPO):** Highest-Paid Person's Opinion wins regardless of data. This kills data culture.

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Diagnose Current State

Evaluate decision-making culture:

| Question | Data-Driven Answer | Political Answer |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|
| Who wins arguments? | Person with best data | Most senior person |
| How is info shared? | Default open | Need-to-know |
| How are goals tracked? | Public OKRs/metrics | Private conversations |
| How fast are decisions? | Days | Weeks |
| Who can challenge? | Anyone with data | Only peers or above |

**Score:** If 3+ answers are "Political," culture change is needed.

### Step 2: Implement OKRs

Objectives and Key Results create transparent goal alignment:

| Component | Definition | Criteria |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| Objectives | What we want to achieve | Qualitative, inspiring, time-bound |
| Key Results | How we know we achieved it | Quantitative, measurable, specific |

**Implementation:**

| Phase | Actions |
|-------|---------|
| Pilot | Start with one team; learn the process |
| Expand | Roll out by function/team over 2-3 quarters |
| Scale | Company-wide OKRs with cascading alignment |

**Cadence:** Quarterly setting, weekly tracking, monthly review.

**Visibility:** All OKRs visible to everyone. "When you meet someone at Google, you read their OKRs."

### Step 3: Design Default-to-Open Systems

Shift from "need to know" to "no reason to hide":

| Information Type | Default | Restrict When |
|------------------|---------|---------------|
| Company goals/OKRs | Open | Never |
| Financial metrics | Open | Pre-IPO specifics |
| Individual goals | Open | Never |
| Project status | Open | Competitive sensitivity |
| Meeting notes | Open | Personnel matters |

**Implementation:**
- Internal wiki/docs accessible by default
- All-hands with open Q&A
- Metrics dashboards visible company-wide
- Explicit reasoning when something is restricted

### Step 4: Redesign Decision-Making

Create systems where data wins:

| Element | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Clear owners | Every decision has one owner |
| Data requirements | Key decisions require data, not just opinions |
| Challenge rights | Anyone can challenge with data |
| Speed expectations | Decisions in days, not weeks |
| Decision records | Capture what, why, data used |

**Meeting structure:**
- Owner presents data and recommendation
- Discussion time-boxed
- Decision made in meeting (not later)
- Disagree and commit after decision

### Step 5: Build Data Capability

Culture requires capability:

| Capability | How to Build |
|------------|--------------|
| Metric literacy | Train everyone on key metrics |
| Data access | Self-serve dashboards and tools |
| Analysis skills | Invest in data science / analytics |
| Data quality | Single source of truth |

**Warning:** Culture fails if people want data but cannot get it.

### Step 6: Reinforce Through Leadership

Model the behavior:

| Leader Behavior | Why It Matters |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Ask "What's the data?" | Signals data requirement |
| Defer to data, not rank | Models desired behavior |
| Publicly change mind when data changes | Shows integrity |
| Praise data-driven challenges | Encourages speaking up |
| Celebrate learning from failed experiments | Removes fear |

## Outputs

| Output | Format |
|--------|--------|
| Culture Diagnosis | Current state assessment |
| OKR Implementation Plan | Pilot + rollout timeline |
| Transparency Policies | What's open, what's restricted, why |
| Decision-Making Framework | Process with data requirements |
| Capability Building Plan | Training and tooling needs |

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```


## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| No data infrastructure | Build capability first; cannot have data culture without data |
| Leadership resistance | Start bottom-up; demonstrate value in pilot |
| Analysis paralysis | Emphasize speed; "quick decision > slow perfection" |
| Weaponized data | Address culture/trust issues first |
| Competitive concerns | Use access controls for sensitive data; most info is not sensitive |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:** "We're a 200-person company where the CEO makes all decisions. VPs bring opinions to meetings but nothing is data-driven. How do we change this?"

**Output:**

### Culture Diagnosis

**Current state:** HiPPO culture
- CEO decides; VPs advocate positions
- Information flows up; decisions flow down
- No visible metrics or OKRs
- Decisions take 2-3 weeks minimum

### 90-Day Transformation Plan

**Month 1: OKR Pilot**

Week 1: Train VP team on OKRs
- 3-5 company Objectives
- 3-4 Key Results each
- Make them visible immediately

Week 2-4: Pilot with one function
- That VP owns full OKR rollout for their team
- Weekly tracking meetings with data
- Document learnings

**Month 2: Decision-Making Reform**

New meeting structure for leadership team:
- Owner presents: "Here is my recommendation, and here is the data"
- Discussion: 15 minutes max per topic
- CEO: "What does the data suggest?" (not "Here's what I think")
- Decision: Made in meeting

New norm: When data contradicts opinion, data wins.

CEO commitment: Publicly defer to data 3+ times per month (be visible about it).

**Month 3: Default-to-Open**

- Create internal dashboard with key metrics
- All OKRs visible company-wide
- Weekly email: "What we learned this week" with data
- All-hands with live Q&A and real answers

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | 90-Day Target |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Decision time | 2-3 weeks | <1 week |
| Decisions with data | ~20% | >60% |
| OKR visibility | 0% | 100% |
| CEO "what's the data" moments | 0 | Daily |

## Integration

This skill is extracted from the **Eric Schmidt** expert. Use Schmidt's voice when applying:
- Frame data culture as accountability without bureaucracy
- Emphasize speed: quick decisions beat slow decisions
- Remember: "We run the company on questions, not answers"
- Data creates accountability without adding layers
